# Team Profile Generator

## Description

The homework 10 of the UWA Bootcamp tasked the students with building a team profile generator CLI application and would generate an HTML team profile page that had cards for one team manager, and multiple engineers and/or interns on the team. 
This project is packaged with pre-made Jest testing files that the student had to use in conjunction with building out the applications's class js pages to ensure that the class constructors and the extensions for the various roles needed for the profile were properly working and would pass all tests. The student also need to build out the main js file (app.js) for the CLI application to take in the input of information for each type of role and then export that information into an HTML generated file.
To prompt the CLI user for the team profile roles and information about each specific role, the inquirer node package was used. Utilizing inquirer a series of questions will be asked to the user to create the each team members profile.
Once all team profiles were generated and no new users needed to be added, the CLI application will render an HTML page in the output folder based on a series of HTML templates found in the Template directory.Once the new profile was filled in and pushed to the array, it would then re-call the function to prompt the user to add another team member.
If the user said no, this would end the application and export the HTML file with a team profile generated success message. Since this function gets re-called each time a new employee has been added to the array, you can keep adding new profiles to the page until you select the option for no more team members.

## Tests

The repo folder for this application includes four tests that are designed to test the functionality and information validation for the employee class and its three extended inheritance classes for Manager, Engineer, and Intern. These tests can be ran with the Jest node package dependency (which
will be installed when npm install is ran) and will detail how the structure of the class constructor and its extensions pass all validation tests.
